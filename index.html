          <h2>Your local library</h2>

          <p>Books to read, music to listen to, movies to watch. All for free.</p>

          <p>A place where you're not limited to consuming only as much culture as you can afford.</p>

        <section class='digital'>
          <h2>This website</h2>

          <p>No books to read, no music to listen to, no movies to watch. We cannot provide them for you here because it would be copyright infringement.</p>

          <p>The Internet is a place where you're limited to consuming only as much culture as you can afford.</p>
        </section>

      <section class='why'>
        <h2>Copyright law is broken</h2>

        <p>We created copyright law to stop people from selling the work of others as their own, not to force people to pay a toll every time they read a book, listen to music, or watch a movie.</p>

        <p>We created free public libraries so that people could consume as much culture as they want for free.</p>

        <p>File sharing sites on the Internet serve exactly the same purpose to society as free public libraries. They allow people to consume as much culture as they want for free.</p>

        <p>But because file sharing is illegal, the world's biggest and best free public digital libraries are tucked away in dark corners of the Internet, filled with shady advertising and a vague sense of shamefulness.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, the website actually named <a href='http://publiclibrary.org'>publiclibrary.org</a> merely represents some random local library in Kentucky. No shady advertising, but just as shameful. A site named something like "publiclibrary.org" should serve a global constituency, not just some random county in Kentucky.</p>

      <section class='legalizesharing'>
        <h2>It doesn't have to be this way</h2>

        <p>We can bring copyright law into the 21st century with one small tweak: legalize noncommercial copyright infringement.</p>

        <p>Commercial copyright infringement should remain illegal. Nobody should have the right to profit from your work but you.</p>

        <p>But if we legalize noncommercial file sharing, this website <a href='http://publiclibrary.org'>or one like it</a> could easily become the most comprehensive free public library in the world.</p>

        <p>It could be a place with books to read, music to listen to, and movies to watch. All for free.</p>

        <p>A place where you're not limited to consuming only as much culture as you can afford.</p>
